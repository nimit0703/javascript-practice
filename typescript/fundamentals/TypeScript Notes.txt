Why should I use TypeScript?

-- JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

-- In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

-- TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

TypeScript Compiler:

TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.

TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!


Type Assignment:

When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:

Explicit : let firstName: string = "Dylan";

Implicit : let firstName = "Dylan";
