# Why Should I Use TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings several advantages to the table. Here are some reasons why you should consider using TypeScript in your projects:

## Strong Typing

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly specify variable types. While this flexibility can be convenient, it can also lead to bugs that are hard to catch during development. TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values, making it easier to understand and enforce the types of data being used in your code.

## Improved Code Readability

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any built-in type information. Developers often have to rely on documentation or guess based on the implementation of functions and variables. TypeScript adds a layer of self-documentation to your code by making types explicit. This makes it easier for developers to understand the intent and usage of different parts of the codebase.

## Early Error Detection

One of the significant advantages of TypeScript is its ability to catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This means that you can catch and fix issues before your code ever runs, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors that can be difficult to debug.

## TypeScript Compiler

TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler. This compilation step ensures that TypeScript is converted into JavaScript that can run in any environment where JavaScript is supported. This means you can use TypeScript in both frontend and backend development, as well as with popular frameworks and libraries.

## Type Assignment

In TypeScript, you can assign types explicitly or rely on type inference:

### Explicit Type Assignment

```typescript
let firstName: string = "Dylan";
